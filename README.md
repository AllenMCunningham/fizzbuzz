# fizzbuzz

This repo is for me to play and gold plate the long beloved "fizzbuzz" problem in multiple languages as I learn them.

```
Fizz Buzz is a very simple programming task, asked in software developer job interviews.

A typical round of Fizz Buzz can be: 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” 
instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”. 
```
I like the variation in (this article)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fizz-buzz-implementation/] as well
